/**
 * Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be 
 * sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The 
 * pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
 * 
 * Family: Exchanging.
 * Space: In-place.
 * Stable: True.
 * 
 * Average case = O(n^2)
 * Worst case = O(n^2)
 * Best case = O(n)
